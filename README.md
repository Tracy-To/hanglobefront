# HanGlobe

HanGlobe is an extensive guide to living in Korea, providing a wide array of resources and insights contributed by users and the community. “Han” refers to Korea or Korean culture, and “Globe” represents the world or a global scope. It serves as a platform where people can share their experiences, offer recommendations, give tips and advice, and help others explore and appreciate the richness of contemporary life and culture in Korea. The content is designed for anyone who is interested in learning about things in Korea, as well as for those currently living in Korea, those who have previously lived there, and those planning to live or travel there.

In HanGlobe, users can contribute content by submitting posts through a simple process. This involves users creating a post, writing content, optionally adding media, choosing a relevant category to post in, and finally reviewing and submitting their post. Once submitted, their post becomes available to the public for viewing and learning, offering additional resources and insights for the community to learn about Korea.

The categories that users can view through and post in are as follows:
- Sights & Landmarks
- Cities & Towns
- Food & Dining
- Cafés
- Activities & Leisure 
- Daily Life Essentials
- Travel Tips

The app has full CRUD functionality availble to the public as of right now, but that's because the app link has only been shared to close friends and family, as well as classmates and instructors. In the near future, I am considering adding log-in functionality, allowing users to post and manage their own content only when logged in. Alternatively, I may continue allowing anyone to post without needing an account. However, the post form will require a passcode key, which will be needed to edit or delete the post. An admin passcode can override this key if necessary.

Feel free to browse the articles and share your own!
